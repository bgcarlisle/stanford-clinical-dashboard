# Responsible Metrics Dashboard

Code repo including the code to calculate the underlying metrics as well as the Shiny app to present the results.

Forked with many thanks from https://github.com/quest-bih/dashboard

## Repo overview

Put all the scripts that are directly involved in preparing data for use in the dashboard in the `prep/` folder. Please indicate what scripts/software/data sources are used to generate the inputs for these in a comment in the code itself.

Put the final output data of these scripts in the `shiny_app/data/` folder. These should only include the data that the dashboard Shiny app uses directly to generate plots.

The `shiny_app/` folder contains the code that is run to generate the Shiny app.
